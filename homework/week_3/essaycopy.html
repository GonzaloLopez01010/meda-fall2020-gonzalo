<h1>History and Societal Views on Body Types</h1>

<div id="firstdiv">
    <p>Knowledge about the body can be gained through books.
For example, back in the days when knowledge about women's 
bodies, in terms of sexual pleasure, weren't well known, 
there was a book published in 1970 called Women and their 
Bodies, which was the first book to ever give women 
"comprehensive knowledge" concerning their health and bodies. 
Because women were then able to understand the way their bodies worked,they were 
able to take control over their bodies, and didn't have to rely on men anymore 
to statisfy them. Another way of gaining knowledge about the body is through 
"experiencing the body itself". What this is saying is that depending on the body
and identity we possess, we gain different knowledge that we base on our everyday
experiences.</p>

<p>Some people and/or agencies have more credibility and 
authority than others in constructing these knowledge due to houw our society 
has been constructed for centuries. Men have always had the most power throughout
history, so it isn't surprising that they were primarily the ones that had the 
most power in convincing people of certain knowledge. An example from the text 
that shows what I previously explained is that up until the 19th centeury, 
childbirth alwasy occured at home with a midwife. However, by 1910, the 
obstetritian field began to kick off, and it was dominated by men from 
"dominant class". Many of these male doctors convinced women to go on drugs to 
alleviate the pain from giving birth. That was the beginning of medicalization, 
and it only increased afterwards. The increase of misinformation spread by male 
physicians caused women to mutilate their bodies through surgery, which resulted 
in death a lot of times. The spread of knowledge that is accepted by the public 
has to do with gender and socioeconomic status, so we can see that 
intersectionality plays a huge role in that situation.</p>

<p>We as a society have been thaught certain ideas about gendered bodies that 
determine what it is that we do to our bodies. The ideas that we are taught come
from many different places, but one of the more common ways we get these ideas
drilled into us is through the media. The media influence has become a bigger 
issue now more than ecer before due to the increase of technology. Women know 
that if they "choose" not to participate in body work, they will be subjected to
critiques. Over 90% or women shave their legs and armpits, while only 18% of men
shave their legs and 30% their armpits. Beauty practices are typically more 
prevalent in women than in men because men are perceived as homosexual if they
appear to be invested in their own personal appearance. This explains why women 
and men both have different feelings regarding their body practices. Despite this,
the masculine beauty ideal is becoming more accepted as our society progresses.

<div id="seconddiv">
    <p>The different types of body that people have definetly influences how they 
experience the world, and the kind of understanding they gain of the world 
through those experiences. The world we live in has always treated people a 
certain way depending on the type of body they have. The kind of body you have 
determines if you get treated in a positive way or in a negative way. It also 
determines the way you view yourself and others.</p>
