<header><h1>Picking up Drawing as a Hobby</h1></header>
<h2> My Hobby and I </h2>
<main>
<p> Hello and welcome to my webpage, my name is Gonzalo Lopez and I love the arts. Interests of mine include ballet, plays, dance choreography, origami, an array music and drawing. The hobby I will be focusing on is drawing. I enjoy drawing because it's something that can take minor planning and can be done either in public or private. You can draw with just a pencil or use a variety of art tools to draw. Most importantly, for me drawing is a great coping mechanism that can alleviate stress. Also, it gives me instant satisfaction seeing the end results. </p>

<h2> How to Start </h2>

<p>Like mentioned above you don't need a complicated set up to begin drawing. You could use a sheet of paper, napkin, or even pavement depending on your art supplies at hand. Some art supplies you can use to draw with include; pencils, pens,  markers, crayons, colored pencils, pastels, water colors, or your fingers to finger paint. </p>




<h2> Resources and Tips </h2>

<p> I recommend watching tutorial videos on youtube, so you can follow along to. A tip I have is to go on google images and search drawings. This lets you practice your skills if you don't know what to draw and gives you endless images.
