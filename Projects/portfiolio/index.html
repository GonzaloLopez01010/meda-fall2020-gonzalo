        <p>My name is Gonzalo Lopez and I am currently enrolled in a web design coding bootcamp. My current skills include basic html and ccs knowledge along with some understanding of JavaScript essentials. I'm also developing my hard and soft skills with online courses. This is my first working with programming languages and learning to program.</P>

        <p> After completing the bootcamp I plan to continue self studying and enrolling into CCSF to pursue a Computer Science Degree. Once I complete my 2 years at CCSF I plan to continue my education at a 4 year college in order to complete my Bachelor's Degree. While I'm attending college I will expand my network by attending events and making close connections with peers.</p>
