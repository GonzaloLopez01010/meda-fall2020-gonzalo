ABOUT ME PAGE

(write about goals, experience, current skills )


The next step I will take towards my career goal will be enrolling into CCSF to pursue a Computer Science Degree. Once I complete my 2 years at CCSF I plan to continue my education at a 4 year college in order to complete my Bachelor's Degree. While I'm attending college I will expand my network by attending events and making close connections with peers.
