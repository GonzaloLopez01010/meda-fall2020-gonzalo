(write about goals, experience, current skills )


The next step I will take towards my career goal will be enrolling into CCSF to pursue a Computer Science Degree. Once I complete my 2 years at CCSF I plan to continue my education at a 4 year college in order to complete my Bachelor's Degree. While I'm attending college I will expand my network by attending events and making close connections with peers.

Things I liked: 
1) That the body section held each project in a square looking similar in size.
2) Another thing I like is that you can see a range of more simple to complex projects.
3) It's easy to tell what the the squares are holding.

Things I don't like:
1) I would have preferred the projects be organized by color when placed next to    eachother. 
2) There is no viewable bottom section for the home page 
3) The colors take a bit away from the aesthetics of the portfolio. They are not consistent.
